            When utilizing the AI model Cohere, which has access to user data files and a history array during runtime, 
            we prioritize privacy and adhere to strict ethical guidelines. User data is processed solely during the application session and is not stored permanently, 
            ensuring that sensitive information remains secure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cohere emphasizes privacy and compliance with applicable laws, advising against uploading personal information and placing the responsibility of lawful data usage on customers. 
            Additionally, safeguards such as encryption and restricted access are implemented to protect data against unauthorized use.
        </p>
        <p>
            By maintaining transparency in how data is handled and limiting its use to runtime, this approach respects user privacy 
            while ensuring compliance with ethical standards and data protection policies.
